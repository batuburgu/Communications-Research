## 🗂 File Naming Convention

All code and figure files follow a structured naming convention to clearly indicate the content and source and the structure is explained below:

- **`fig{n}`**: Indicates the figure numbers included.  

- **`{paperID}`**: Refers to the paper from which the figures or simulations are derived:  

### 📌 Example

A file named: **`fig1x3x5_18_2`** means it contains MATLAB code to generate Figures **1**, **3**, and **5** from the paper coded **18.2**.
